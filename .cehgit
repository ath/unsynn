  cehgit is a frontend for githooks that runs bash scripts (actions) in sequence. This acts
  much like a CI but for your local git repository. Unlike other 'pre-commit' solutions it will
  not alter your worktree by stashing changes for the test but run tests in dedicated
  directories which are kept around for later inspection and improving test performance. There
  are plans to make cehgit running the tests in the background while you are editing the commit
  message to improve turnaround times even further. It is possible to implement complete release
  workflows in cehgit.

  cehgit caches the state of the last run tests and reuses the test directories when the git
  tree did not change. This allows for incremental testing and faster turnaround times.
  It schedule tests to run in background. This means tests may run while you type a commit
  message.

  When you read this because you seen '.cehgit' used in a repository then you may look at
  INITIAL INSTALLATION below.


USAGE

  cehgit [-h|--help|help]
         show this help

  cehgit init [-f|--force|--upgrade]
         initialize or upgrade cehgit

  cehgit install-action [-f|--force] [--all|actionglob..]
         install actions that are shipped with cehgit

         delete cehgit controlled githooks

  cehgit list-hooks
         list all githooks that point to cehgit

  cehgit clean
         remove all test directories

  ./.cehgit [..]
         same as 'cehgit' above but calling the repo local version

  ./.git/hooks/* [OPTIONS..]
         invoking git hooks manually


SETUP

  To use cehgit in a git repository it has first to be initialized with 'cehgit init'.
  This copies itself to a repository local '.cehgit' and creates the '.cehgit.d/'
  directory. 'cehgit init --upgrade' will upgrade an already initialized version.

  Then the desired actions have to be written or installed. 'cehgit install-action --all'
  will copy all actions shipped with cehgit to '.cehgit.d/'. This should always be safe
  but may include more than one may want and implement some opinionated workflow. Thus
  the installed actions are meant to be customized to personal preferences.

  By default cehgit does not create a '.cehgit.conf' file. The defaults should be
  sufficient for most use cases. When not, then one can create the config file and
  customize it.

  cehgit puts tests in sub-directories starting with '.test-*'. This pattern should be
  added to '.gitignore'.

  '.cehgit', '.cehgit.d/*' and '.cehgit.conf' are meant to be commited into git and
  versioned.

  Once this is set up one should 'cehgit install-hooks [--all]' to setup the desired hooks
  locally. Note that installed hooks are not under version control and every checkout of
  the repository has to install them manually again.

  This completes the setup, cehgit should now by called whenever git invokes a hook.


HOW CEHGIT WORKS

  Cehgit is implemented in bash the test actions are sourced in sorted order. Bash was chosen
  because of it's wide availability and more addvanced features than standard shells. It relies
  on some bashisms. To make shell programming a little more safe it calls 'set -ue' which ensures
  that variables are declared before used and exits on the first failure.

  Test are run in locally created test directories, the worktree itself is not altered/stashed.
  This test directories are populated from the currently staged files in the working tree. The
  '\$TEST_DIR/.git/' directory is symlinked to the original '../.git'.

  Test directries are reused when they orginate from the same git tree (hash), cehgit deliberately
  does not start from a clean/fresh directory to take advantage of incremental compilation and
  artifacts from former runs to speed tests up. All actions on a tree are logged and this log
  is used to query cached results.

  It keeps the last KEEP_TESTS around and removes excess ones.

  When invoked as githook a test directory is created or reused and entered. Then all actions in
  ACTIONS_DIR are sourced in sorted order. Actions determine by API calls if they should execute,
  schedule to background or exit early. 'init_' actions can be used to extend the API.

  API calls with also log the progress, ok/fail states will be reused in subsequent runs.

  The test directories left behind can be inspected at later time. There will be a 'test.log'
  where the stdout of all actions that run is collected.

  To debug cehgit execution itself one can set VERBOSITY_LEVEL to a number up to
  4 (0=none, 1=info, 2=error, 3=debug, 4=trace)


BACKGROUND DETAILS

  Schedule actions to background will finish the currently running hook early before
  this background actions are completed. Background actions will then be scheduled after all
  foreground actions completed successful.

  Background actions should finish with a conclusive ok or fail. Using 'run_test' will take
  care of that.

  Example Action:

   # background_schedule will succeed when this action is scheduled and fail when
   # thus we '&& return 0' to exit when scheduled and fall through on fail
   background_schedule && return 0
   # To retrieve the result of the background action use background_wait and background_result
   # this falls through when no background action was scheduled
   background_wait && return \$(background_result)
   # eventually run the actual code
   run_test make

  cehgit utilizes the pre-commit hook to schedule expensive tests into the background.
  Then while the user enters a commit message the tests run and the commit-msg hook checks
  for the outcome of the tests.


CONFIGURATION

  cehgit can be configured by setting variables in '~/config/cehgit.conf',
  '~/.cehgit.conf' and './.cehgit.conf'. The later is the repository local configuration which
  should be under version control.

  Following Variables can be configured [=default]:

$(sed 's/ *declare -gx \([^ ]*\)=\([^ ]*\) *#G *\(.*\)/  \1 [\2]\n    \3 \n/p;d' < "$0")


WRITING ACTIONS

  cehgit sources all actions in order and aborts execution on the first failure.

  All actions must be prefixed with 'init_' or a double digit number to ensure proper ordering.
  It is recommended to follow following guides for the naming:

  - init_ early init/shell functions
    Define shell function and state variables, this actions are unconditionally sourced at the
    very begin.
  - 10 configuration and prepopulation
    When some adjustments are to be done to make the test dir compileable this is the place.
  - 20 validate test dir, toolchain versions
    Check for presence and validty of files in the test dir.
    Check for toolchains/tools, required versions
  - 30 linters/formatting check
    Testing begins here with resonable cheap checks, running linters and similar things.
  - 40 building
    This is where compilation happens, we are building the project, tests etc. here. But do
    not run them yet.
  - 50 normal testing
    Runs the standard testsuite. The shipped actions will background these tests.
  - 60 extensive testing/mutants/fuzzing
    When there are any expensive tests like running mutant checks, fuzzing, benchmarks this
    is done here. The shipped actions will background these tests.
  - 70 doc
    Generate documentation, possibly test it.
  - 80 staging work, release chores, changelogs
    When some automatic workflow should be implemented like promoting/merging branches,
    generating changelogs etc, this is done here.
  - 90 packaging/deploy/postprocessing
    Final step for automatic workflows which may build packages and deploy it.
    Also if any final processing/cleanup has to be done.

  The first word after 'init_'  or the double digits should be a descriptive name of what tool
  the action uses. 'cehgit action-install' accepts globs to install multiple matching actions at
  once.

  Actions should have comments starting with '##' which will be extracted on 'cehgit list-actions'
  and 'cehgit available-actions' giving some info about what an action does.

  Actions can do different things:
  - Unconditionally define functions and variables to be used later. This must be done
    in 'init_*' actions. We run bash in a strict mode that would exit cehgit on the first fail.
    Thus if any expected failure must be handled and turned into a successful exitcode.
    Usually something like 'allowed_to_fail || return 0' is used in this case.

      function run_at_friday
      {
          # do whatever the function shall do
          # may return a exitcode that indicates a failure which must be handled by the caller
          [[ \$(date +%u) = 5 ]] || {
             return 1
          }
       }

  - Calling functions that check whenever the action should be in effect or not.
    cehgit calls all actions in order. Some actions should only run under certain conditions.
    Each action may return early when it should not run. The API provides functions to check
    the current git branch or the hook that is running and to schedule actions to run in the
    background and retrieve its results. These functions check for some conditions and return 1
    when the condition is not met. There are already some of such test functions predefined,
    others can be be created in init_* actions.
    This must be handled by the caller otherwise cehgit will exit with a failure:

      run_at_friday || return 0
      git_branch master || return 0
      git_hook pre-commit || return 0
      background_schedule && return 0
      background_wait && return \$(background_result)
      ...

  - Call an actual test. This is usually done by the run_test function that is part of cehgit
    It takes the command to run as parameters and runs this in a subshell with some (configurable)
    resource limits applied. On a Makefile based project this may be something like:

       run_test make check

  Actions are run within the TEST_DIR being the current directory.


AVAILABLE ACTIONS

  Some actions is shipped with cehgit. More will be added in future. These
  implement and eventually evolve into an automated workflow.

$($0 available-actions | awk '{print "  " $0}')

BUILTIN ACTION FUNCTIONS

  cehgit provides a minimal set of built-in functions to be used in actions. Most functionality
  should be implemented in 00* actions itself.

  This functions return 0 on success and 1 on failure. They may set CEHGIT_STATE. A 'return 1'
  must be handled otherwise cehgit would exit. Ususally this is done by 'some_action_function || return 0'.
  Using a 'if' or other operators is possible as well.

$(sed 's/^\(function \([^ ]*\) *\)\?#afunc \(\([^-]*\) *-\)\? *\(.*\)/  \2 \4\n     \5\n/p;d' < "$0")


API FUNCTIONS

  We define a few functions for diagnostics, locking and to record states:

$(sed 's/^function \([^ ]*\) *#api \([^-]*\) *- *\(.*\)/  \1 \2\n     \3\n/p;d' < "$0")

  For further documentation look into the source.


INITIAL INSTALLATION

  cehgit can be invoked in 3 ways:

  1. Installed in \$PATH:
     This is used to initialize cehgit in git repositories and install actions and hooks.
     'cehgit init' copies itself to './.cehgit' and creates a './.cehgit.d/' directory
     when called in a git repository.
     The recommended way to install cehgit in \$PATH
  2. The local './.cehgit' initialized from above:
     This should be versioned, so anyone who clones a git repository where cehgit is
     initialized can use this local version.
  3. githooks symlinked from './.git/hooks/*' -> '../../.cehgit'
     When called as githook, then it calls actions in './.cehgit.d/' in order.

  To make 1. work it is best to clone cehgit locally and symlink the checked out files
  to your '.local/' tree. This allows easy upgrades via git:

    # clone the repository and change into it
    git clone https://git.pipapo.org/cehgit
    cd cehgit

    # symlink the script itself
    ln -s $PWD/cehgit $HOME/.local/bin/
    # symlink the actions directory
    mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/cehgit
    ln -s $PWD/actions $HOME/.local/share/cehgit/

  You can manually copy or symlink either from above to '/usr/bin' and '/usr/share' as well.


SECURITY

  cehgit is completely inert in a initialized or freshly checked out repository. One always
  has to './.cehgit install-hook' to enable it. Then as any other build script cehgit actions
  run in the context of the calling user. Unlike in a CI there is no isolation. Thus before
  hooks are enabled the user is responsible to check or trust the shipped actions.
