The 0.0.x series are *very* unstable and may break with every commit, there will be frequent
releases to get feedback. Since 0.0.6 it goes into some battle testing for writing a small
proc macro that does not need to parse rust syntax. Once that is settled a initial 0.1.0
release will be made with a more stable API. From there on the planned 'unsynn-rust' and along
that a 'unsynn-derive' will be implemented. When the later two are working and no major
deficiencies in 'unsynn' are found then it is time for a 1.0.0 release.

# Development
